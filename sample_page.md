### 1. Survival Fox Game

Using the Unity Engine, I created a game to learn the basics of game development. I learned the basics of Object Oriented Programming.
I manged to read player inputs, and autonomously instantiate game objects at random locations within bounds. I also managed to make these randomly generated game objects interact with the player character. This project is still under development, as the aesthetics of it are very basic. I will later implement animations, and better UI elements. What is done are the core functionalities of the game such as player input, enemy spawning, collectable items, option menu sliders, and game data that saves through play sessions.

Since this is my first experience in the Unity Engine, learning by myself was very difficult. Much of my time was spent reading various APIs, documentations, and looking at many forums regarding some quirks in Unity. Since I am still in University, finding the time to work on this project is also difficult, but I think this experience has been well worth it. Game development is a passion of mine, and even my professional career does not involve game design, I plan on wokring on personal projects beside my professional career.


### 2. Dialer Application

Using the Qt Application Creator, I created a phone dialer app. This application read in user input numbers, and filtered out a 
contact list by number, and letters corresponding to numbers. This application also presented users instant feedback via visual
cues, changing button colors when they are selected. Creating this application, I learned how to interact with a database, and 
how to create user-interfaces. 

### 3. Command Line Snake

Using C++, I created the classic snake game played in the terminal. Within this game the player moves the snake head around, and fruit are randomly generated on the game board. When consumed, the snake's tail will increase in length, and the game will speed up. The player will lose in the event that the snake head makes contact with its own tail, or the boundary of the game board. 
In this personal project, I learned how to manage a complex data structure that is constantly changing. I also learned how to work with two-dimensional matrices, and further familiarized myself with basic game design.
