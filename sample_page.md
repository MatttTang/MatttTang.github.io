### 1. Platformer Game

Using the Unity Engine, I created a game to learn the basics of game development. I learned the basics of Object Oriented Programming.
I manged to read player inputs, and added animations to the sprite to enhance gameplay. 


### 2. Dialer Application

Using the Qt Application Creator, I created a phone dialer app. This application read in user input numbers, and filtered out a 
contact list by number, and letters corresponding to numbers. This application also presented users instant feedback via visual
cues, changing button colors when they are selected. Creating this application, I learned how to interact with a database, and 
how to create user-interfaces.
